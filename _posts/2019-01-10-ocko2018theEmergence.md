> One of the most striking aspects of early visual processing in the retina is the immediate parcellation of visual information into 
> multiple parallel pathways, formed by different retinal ganglion cell types each tiling the entire visual field. Existing theories of 
> efficient coding have been unable to account for the functional advantages of such cell-type diversity in encoding natural scenes. Here 
> we go beyond previous theories to analyze how a simple linear retinal encoding model with different convolutional cell types efficiently 
> encodes naturalistic spatiotemporal movies given a fixed firing rate budget. We find that optimizing the receptive fields and cell 
> densities of two cell types makes them match the properties of the two main cell types in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells, 
> in terms of spatial and temporal sensitivity, cell spacing, and their relative ratio. Moreover, our theory gives a precise account of 
> how the ratio of midget to parasol cells decreases with retinal eccentricity. Also, we train a nonlinear encoding model with a 
> rectifying nonlinearity to efficiently encode naturalistic movies, and again find emergent receptive fields resembling those of midget 
> and parasol cells that are now further subdivided into ON and OFF types. Thus our work provides a theoretical justification, based on 
> the efficient coding of natural movies, for the existence of the four most dominant cell types in the primate retina that together 
> comprise 70% of all ganglion cells.
