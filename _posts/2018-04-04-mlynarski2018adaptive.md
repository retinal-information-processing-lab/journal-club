> Behavior relies on the ability of sensory systems to infer properties of the
> environment from incoming stimuli. The accuracy of inference depends on the
> fidelity with which behaviorally-relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in
> neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but
> low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we discuss general
> principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference
> error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this
> tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural
> representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce
> fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution. We predict
> dynamical signatures of such encoding schemes and demonstrate how known
> phenomena, such as burst coding and firing rate adaptation, can be understood
> as hallmarks of optimal coding for accurate inference.
