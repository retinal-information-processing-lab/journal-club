> Recent experimental results based on multielectrode and imaging techniques
> have reinvigorated the idea that large neural networks operate near a critical
> point, between order and disorder. However, evidence for criticality has
> relied on the definition of arbitrary order parameters, or on models that do
> not address the dynamical nature of network activity. Here we introduce a
> novel approach to assess criticality that overcomes these limitations, while
> encompassing and generalizing previous criteria. We find a simple model to
> describe the global activity of large populations of ganglion cells in the rat
> retina, and show that their statistics are poised near a critical point.
> Taking into account the temporal dynamics of the activity greatly enhances the
> evidence for criticality, revealing it where previous methods would not. The
> approach is general and could be used in other biological networks.
