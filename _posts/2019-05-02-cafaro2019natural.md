> Neural population codes discovered for simple artificial stimuli may not generalize to more naturalistic conditions. To explore this problem, we measured how populations of directionselective ganglion cells (DSGCs) from mouse retina respond to a dynamic global motion stimulus that mimics self-motion through the environment. We then examined the encoding and decoding of motion direction in both individual and populations of DSGCs. Individual cells integrated global motion over ~200 ms, and responses were tuned to direction. However, responses were sparse, and broadly tuned, which severely limited decoding performance from small populations. In contrast, larger populations compensated for response sparsity, enabling decoding with high temporal precision (<100 ms). At these timescales, correlated spiking was minimal and had little impact on decoding performance, unlike results obtained using simpler motion stimuli decoded over longer timescales. We use these data to define and explore different DSGC population decoding regimes that utilize or mitigate correlated spiking to achieve high spatial versus high temporal resolution.
