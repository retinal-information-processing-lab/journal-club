> Neurons in sensory cortex are tuned to diverse features in natural scenes.
> But what determines which features neurons become selective to? Here we
> explore the idea that neuronal selectivity is optimised to represent features
> in the recent sensory past that best predict immediate future inputs. We
> tested this hypothesis using simple feedforward neural networks, which were
> trained to predict the next few video or audio frames in clips of natural
> scenes. The networks developed receptive fields that closely matched those of
> real cortical neurons in different mammalian species, including the oriented
> spatial tuning of primary visual cortex, the frequency selectivity of primary
> auditory cortex and, most notably, their temporal tuning properties.
> Furthermore, the better a network predicted future inputs the more closely its
> receptive fields resembled those in the brain. This suggests that sensory
> processing is optimised to extract those features with the most capacity to
> predict future input.
