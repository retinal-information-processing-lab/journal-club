> The mammalian retina contains more than a dozen different ganglion cell types,
> each with dendrites ramifying at different strata within the inner plexiform
> layer (IPL) and each carrying a unique representation of the visual world. We
> studied the inhibitory and excitatory inputs, as well as the spiking output,
> of each of the rabbit retinal ganglion cell type during rapid global shifts in
> 'natural' videos designed to mimic saccadic eye movements. These shifts
> generated stratum-specific transient inhibitory activity, affecting only those
> ganglion cells whose dendrites ramify within the central strata of the IPL.
> The inhibition was GABA-mediated, acted both pre- and postsynaptically and was
> fast enough to either prevent or delay spiking. These findings indicate that
> the fast, transient elevation of visual threshold during rapid shifts in scene
> has a significant retinal component.
