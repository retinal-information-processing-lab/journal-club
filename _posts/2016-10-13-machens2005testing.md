> According to Barlow’s seminal “efficient coding hypothesis,” the coding
> strategy of sensory neurons should be matched to the statistics of stimuli
> that occur in an animal’s natural habitat. Using an automatic search
> technique, we here test this hypothesis and identify stimulus ensembles that
> sensory neurons are optimized for. Focusing on grasshopper auditory receptor
> neurons, we find that their optimal stimulus ensembles differ from the natural
> environment, but largely overlap with a behaviorally important sub-ensemble of
> the natural sounds. This indicates that the receptors are optimized for peak
> rather than average performance. More generally, our results suggest that the
> coding strategies of sensory neurons are heavily influenced by differences in
> behavioral relevance among natural stimuli.
