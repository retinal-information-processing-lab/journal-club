> The brain generates increasingly complex representations of the visual world
> to recognize objects, to form new memories, and to organize visual behavior.
> Relatively simple signals in the retina are transformed through a cascade of
> neural computations into highly complex responses in visual cortical areas
> deep in the temporal lobe. The representations of visual signals in areas that
> lie in the middle of this cascade remain poorly understood, yet they are
> critical to understanding how the cascade operates. Here, we demonstrate
> changes in the representation of visual information from area V1 to V2, and
> show how these changes extract and represent information about the local
> statistical features of visual images.
