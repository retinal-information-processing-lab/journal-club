> Components of neural circuits are often repurposed so that the same biological
> hardware can be used for distinct computations. This flexibility in circuit
> operation is required to account for the changes in sensory computations that
> accompany changes in input signals. Yet we know little about how such changes
> in circuit operation are implemented. Here we show that a single retinal
> ganglion cell performs a different computation in dim light—averaging contrast
> within its receptive field—than in brighter light, when the cell becomes
> sensitive to fine spatial detail. This computational change depends on
> interactions between two parallel circuits that control the ganglion cell’s
> excitatory synaptic inputs. Specifically, steady-state interactions through
> dendro-axonal gap junctions control rectification of the synapses providing
> excitatory input to the ganglion cell. These findings provide a clear example
> of how a simple synaptic mechanism can repurpose a neural circuit to perform
> diverse computations.
