> Complexity of neural systems often makes impracticable explicit measurements
> of all interactions between their constituents. Inverse statistical physics
> approaches, which infer effective couplings between neurons from their spiking
> activity, have been so far hindered by their computational complexity. Here,
> we present 2 complementary, computationally efficient inverse algorithms based
> on the Ising and “leaky integrate-and-fire” models. We apply those algorithms
> to reanalyze multielectrode recordings in the salamander retina in darkness
> and under random visual stimulus. We find strong positive couplings between
> nearby ganglion cells common to both stimuli, whereas long-range couplings
> appear under random stimulus only. The uncertainty on the inferred couplings
> due to limitations in the recordings (duration, small area covered on the
> retina) is discussed. Our methods will allow real-time evaluation of couplings
> for large assemblies of neurons.
