> Neural circuits display complex activity patterns both spontaneously and when
> responding to a stimulus or generating a motor output. How are these two forms
> of activity related? We develop a procedure called FORCE learning for
> modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural
> network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired
> activity patterns. FORCE learning works even though the networks we train are
> spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during
> learning. Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide
> variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require
> memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor
> patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on
> premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic
> plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than
> generally appreciated.
