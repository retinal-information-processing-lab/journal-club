> Inhibitory interneurons are diverse in the nervous system, though most have
> unknown functions. In sensory systems, two broad classes of computation have
> been considered, linear effects that generate the classical receptive field and
> nonlinear modulation that mediates non-classical contextual effects. Here we
> analyze salamander retinal amacrine cells using a general approach to directly
> measure and model how an interneuron pathway influences computation. Using
> simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording, we measure the linear
> feature contributed by an amacrine pathway and nonlinear modulatory effects on
> other visual features. We find great diversity in the functional effects of
> amacrine cells, with even apparently simple, linear amacrine cells creating both
> linear and diverse modulatory effects such as divisive gain control, polarity
> reversal and shifting threshold on distinct visual features conveyed to single
> target ganglion cells. The functional effects of amacrine cells parallel the
> previously noted anatomical and molecular heterogeneity of this interneuron
> population.
