> Throughout different sensory systems, individual neurons integrate incoming
> signals over their receptive fields. The characteristics of this signal
> integration are crucial determinants for the neurons' functions. For ganglion
> cells in the vertebrate retina, receptive fields are characterized by the
> well-known center-surround structure and, although several studies have
> addressed spatial integration in the receptive field center, little is known
> about how visual signals are integrated in the surround. Therefore, we set out
> here to characterize signal integration and to identify relevant
> nonlinearities in the receptive field surround of ganglion cells in the
> isolated salamander retina by recording spiking activity with extracellular
> electrodes under visual stimulation of the center and surround. To quantify
> nonlinearities of spatial integration independently of subsequent
> nonlinearities of spike generation, we applied the technique of iso-response
> measurements as follows: using closed-loop experiments, we searched for
> different stimulus patterns in the surround that all reduced the center-evoked
> spiking activity by the same amount. The identified iso-response stimuli
> revealed strongly nonlinear spatial integration in the receptive field
> surrounds of all recorded cells. Furthermore, cell types that had been shown
> previously to have different nonlinearities in receptive field centers showed
> similar surround nonlinearities but differed systematically in the adaptive
> characteristics of the surround. Finally, we found that there is an optimal
> spatial scale of surround suppression; suppression was most effective when
> surround stimulation was organized into subregions of several hundred
> micrometers in diameter, indicating that the surround is composed of subunits
> that have strong center-surround organization themselves.
