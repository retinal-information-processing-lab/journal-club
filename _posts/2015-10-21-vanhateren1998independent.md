> Simple cells in the primary visual cortex process incoming visual information
> with receptive fields localized in space and time, bandpass in spatial and
> temporal frequency, tuned in orientation, and commonly selective for the
> direction of movement. It is shown that performing independent component
> analysis (ICA) on video sequences of natural scenes produces results with
> qualitatively similar spatio-temporal properties. Whereas the independent
> components of video resemble moving edges or bars, the independent component
> filters, i.e. the analogues of receptive fields, resemble moving sinusoids
> windowed by steady Gaussian envelopes. Contrary to earlier ICA results on
> static images, which gave only filters at the finest possible spatial scale,
> the spatioâ€“temporal analysis yields filters at a range of spatial and temporal
> scales. Filters centred at low spatial frequencies are generally tuned to
> faster movement than those at high spatial frequencies.
