> Retinal amacrine cells are a diverse population of inhibitory interneurons, posing a challenge to understand the specific roles of those interneurons in computations of the similarly diverse ganglion cell population. Here we record from both populations simultaneously in the salamander retina to study the predictive computation of motion anticipation, which is thought to compensate for processing delays when encoding moving objects. We recorded the membrane potential of the amacrine cell population optically while recording electrically from ganglion cells with a multielectrode array. By correlating thousands of amacrine and ganglion cell pairs, we modeled the contribution of the traveling wave of activity for different amacrine cell populations to the encoding of a moving bar. We find that the population responses of slow transient amacrine cells can quantitatively account for ganglion cell motion anticipation, supporting a role for this specific amacrine cell class in the predictive encoding of moving stimuli.
