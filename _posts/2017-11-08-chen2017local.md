> A basic scheme of neuronal organization in the mammalian retina is the
> segregation of ON and OFF pathways in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where
> glutamate is released from ON and OFF bipolar cell terminals in separate inner
> (ON) and outer (OFF) sublayers in response to light intensity increments and
> decrements, respectively. However, recent studies have found that
> vGluT3-expressing glutamatergic amacrine cells (GACs) generate ON-OFF somatic
> responses and release glutamate onto both ON and OFF ganglion cell types,
> raising the possibility of crossover excitation in violation of the canonical
> ON-OFF segregation scheme. To test this possibility, we recorded light-evoked
> Ca2+ responses from dendrites of individual GACs infected with GCaMP6s in
> mouse. Under two-photon imaging, a single GAC generated rectified local
> dendritic responses, showing ON-dominant responses in ON sublayers and
> OFF-dominant responses in OFF sublayers. This unexpected ON-OFF segregation
> within a small-field amacrine cell arose from local synaptic processing,
> mediated predominantly by synaptic inhibition. Multiple forms of synaptic
> inhibition compartmentalized the GAC dendritic tree and endowed all dendritic
> varicosities with a small-center, strong-surround receptive field, which
> varied in receptive field size and degree of ON-OFF asymmetry with IPL depth.
> The results reveal a form of short-range dendritic autonomy that enables a
> small-field, dual-transmitter amacrine cell to process diverse dendritic
> functions in a stratification level- and postsynaptic target-specific manner,
> while preserving the fundamental ON-OFF segregation scheme for parallel visual
> processing and high spatial resolution for small object motion and uniformity
> detection.
