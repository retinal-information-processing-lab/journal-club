> Sensory systems continually adjust the way stimuli are processed. What are the
> circuit mechanisms underlying this plasticity? We investigated how synapses in
> the retina of zebrafish adjust to changes in the temporal contrast of a visual
> stimulus by imaging activity in vivo. Following an increase in contrast,
> bipolar cell synapses with strong initial responses depressed, whereas
> synapses with weak initial responses facilitated. Depression and facilitation
> predominated in different strata of the inner retina, where bipolar cell
> output was anticorrelated with the activity of amacrine cell synapses
> providing inhibitory feedback. Pharmacological block of GABAergic feedback
> converted facilitating bipolar cell synapses into depressing ones. These
> results indicate that depression intrinsic to bipolar cell synapses causes
> adaptation of the ganglion cell response to contrast, whereas depression in
> amacrine cell synapses causes sensitization. Distinct microcircuits
> segregating to different layers of the retina can cause simultaneous increases
> or decreases in the gain of neural responses.
