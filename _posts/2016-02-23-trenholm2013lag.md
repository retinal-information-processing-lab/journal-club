> Moving objects can cover large distances while they are processed by the eye,
> usually resulting in a spatially lagged retinal response. We identified a
> network of electrically coupled motionâ€“coding neurons in mouse retina that act
> collectively to register the leading edges of moving objects at a nearly
> constant spatial location, regardless of their velocity. These results reveal
> a previously unknown neurophysiological substrate for lag normalization in the
> visual system.
