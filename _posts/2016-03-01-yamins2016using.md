> Fueled by innovation in the computer vision and artificial intelligence
> communities, recent developments in computational neuroscience have used
> goal-driven hierarchical convolutional neural networks (HCNNs) to make strides
> in modeling neural single-unit and population responses in higher visual
> cortical areas. In this Perspective, we review the recent progress in a
> broader modeling context and describe some of the key technical innovations
> that have supported it. We then outline how the goal-driven HCNN approach can
> be used to delve even more deeply into understanding the development and
> organization of sensory cortical processing.
