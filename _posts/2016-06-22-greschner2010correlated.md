> This paper examines the correlated firing among multiple ganglion cell types
> in the retina. For many years it has been known that ganglion cells exhibit a
> tendency to fire simultaneously more or less frequently than would be
> predicted by chance. However, the particular patterns of correlated activity
> in the primate retina have been unclear. Here we reveal systematic,
> distance‐dependent correlations between different ganglion cell types. For the
> most part, the patterns of activity are consistent with a model in which noise
> in cone photoreceptors propagates through common retinal circuitry, creating
> correlations among ganglion cell signals.
