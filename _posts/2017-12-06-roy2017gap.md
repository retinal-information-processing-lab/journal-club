> Neuron ensembles in the brain visual system often show correlated responses,
> but the sensory information encoded by this activity remains unclear. Here, we
> show that widely separated ganglion cells in the mouse retina show correlated
> activity when presented with a large, contiguous object, but not when the
> object is disjointed. We show that these long-range correlations are produced
> by electrical coupling via gap junctions made with polyaxonal amacrine cells,
> which can span distances greater than a millimeter. Blockade or ablation of
> these gap junctions eliminates correlations between distant ganglion cells and,
> moreover, diminishes an animalâ€™s ability to discriminate large, solid objects
> from disjointed ones. Our findings indicate that long-range correlated
> activity in the retina encodes visual information critical for global object
> perception.
