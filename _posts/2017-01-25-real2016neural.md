> Advances in technology are opening new windows on the structural connectivity
> and functional dynamics of brain circuits. Quantitative frameworks are needed
> that integrate these data from anatomy and physiology. Here, we present a
> modeling approach that creates such a link. The goal is to infer the structure
> of a neural circuit from sparse neural recordings, using partial knowledge of
> its anatomy as a regularizing constraint. We recorded visual responses from
> the output neurons of the retina, the ganglion cells. We then generated a
> systematic sequence of circuit models that represents retinal neurons and
> connections and fitted them to the experimental data. The optimal models
> faithfully recapitulated the ganglion cell outputs. More importantly, they
> made predictions about dynamics and connectivity among unobserved neurons
> internal to the circuit, and these were subsequently confirmed by experiment.
> This circuit inference framework promises to facilitate the integration and
> understanding of big data in neuroscience.
