> Identical sensory inputs can be perceived as markedly different when embedded
> in distinct contexts. Neural responses to simple stimuli are also modulated by
> context, but the contribution of this modulation to the processing of natural
> sensory input is unclear. We measured surround suppression, a quintessential
> contextual influence, in macaque primary visual cortex with natural images. We
> found that suppression strength varied substantially for different images.
> This variability was not well explained by existing descriptions of surround
> suppression, but it was predicted by Bayesian inference about statistical
> dependencies in images. In this framework, surround suppression was flexible:
> it was recruited when the image was inferred to contain redundancies and
> substantially reduced in strength otherwise. Thus, our results reveal a gating
> of a basic, widespread cortical computation by inference about the statistics
> of natural input.
