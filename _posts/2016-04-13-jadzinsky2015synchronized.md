> Sensory stimuli have varying statistics influenced by both the environment and
> by active sensing behaviors that rapidly and globally change the sensory
> input. Consequently, sensory systems often adjust their neural code to the
> expected statistics of their sensory input to transmit novel sensory
> information. Here, we show that sudden peripheral motion amplifies and
> accelerates information transmission in salamander ganglion cells in a 50 ms
> time window. Underlying this gating of information is a transient increase in
> adaptation to contrast, enhancing sensitivity to a broader range of stimuli.
> Using a model and natural images, we show that this effect coincides with an
> expected increase in information in bipolar cells after a global image shift.
> Our findings reveal the dynamic allocation of energy resources to increase
> neural activity at times of expected high information content, a principle of
> adaptation that balances the competing requirements of conserving spikes and
> transmitting information.
