> Neural circuits reliably encode and transmit signals despite the presence of
> noise at multiple stages of processing. The efficient coding hypothesis, a
> guiding principle in computational neuroscience, suggests that a neuron or
> population of neurons allocates its limited range of responses as efficiently
> as possible to best encode inputs while mitigating the effects of noise.
> Previous work on this question relies on specific assumptions about where
> noise enters a circuit, limiting the generality of the resulting conclusions.
> Here we systematically investigate how noise introduced at different stages of
> neural processing impacts optimal coding strategies. Using simulations and a
> flexible analytical approach, we show how these strategies depend on the
> strength of each noise source, revealing under what conditions the different
> noise sources have competing or complementary effects. We draw two primary
> conclusions: (1) differences in encoding strategies between sensory systems—or
> even adaptational changes in encoding properties within a given system—may be
> produced by changes in the structure or location of neural noise, and (2)
> characterization of both circuit nonlinearities as well as noise are necessary
> to evaluate whether a circuit is performing efficiently.
