> Almost every neuron in the early visual system has some form of an
> antagonistic receptive field surround. But the function of the surround is
> poorly understood, especially under naturalistic stimulus conditions.
> Anatomical and functional characterization of the surround of retinal ganglion
> cells suggests that surround signals combine with the excitatory feedforward
> pathway upstream of an important synaptic nonlinearity between bipolar cells
> and postsynaptic ganglion cells. This circuit architecture suggests at least
> two unexplored consequences for receptive field structure. First, center and
> surround inputs should interact nonlinearly, even prior to the summation
> across visual space that forms the full receptive field center. Second, inputs
> to the surround may alter the sensitivity of the center to spatial contrast in
> a scene. We test these hypotheses using both synthetic and naturalistic visual
> stimuli, and find that the statistics of natural scenes promote these
> nonlinear interactions. This work shows that, unexpectedly, the surround
> modulates spatial contrast encoding based on visual context.
