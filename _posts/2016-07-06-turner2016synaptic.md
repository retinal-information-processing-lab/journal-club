> A central goal in the study of any sensory system is to predict neural
> responses to complex inputs, especially those encountered during natural
> stimulation. Nowhere is the transformation from stimulus to response better
> understood than the vertebrate retina. Nevertheless, descriptions of retinal
> computation are largely based on stimulation using artificial visual stimuli,
> and it is unclear how these descriptions map onto the encoding of natural
> stimuli. We demonstrate that nonlinear spatial integration, a common feature
> of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) processing, shapes neural responses to natural
> visual stimuli in primate Off parasol RGCs, whereas On parasol RGCs exhibit
> surprisingly linear spatial integration. Despite this asymmetry, both cell
> types show strong nonlinear integration when presented with artificial
> stimuli. We show that nonlinear integration of natural stimuli is a
> consequence of rectified excitatory synaptic input and that accounting for
> nonlinear spatial integration substantially improves models that predict RGC
> responses to natural images.
