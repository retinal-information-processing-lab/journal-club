> Standard models of stimulus encoding in the retina postulate that image
> presentations activate neurons according to the increase of preferred contrast
> inside the receptive field. During natural vision, however, images do not
> arrive in isolation, but follow each other rapidly, separated by sudden gaze
> shifts. We here report that, contrary to standard models, specific ganglion
> cells in mouse retina are suppressed after a rapid image transition by changes
> in visual patterns across the transition, but respond with a distinct spike
> burst when the same pattern reappears. This sensitivity to image recurrence
> depends on opposing effects of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition and can be
> explained by a circuit of local serial inhibition. Rapid image transitions
> thus trigger a mode of operation that differs from the processing of simpler
> stimuli and allows the retina to tag particular image parts or to detect
> transition types that lead to recurring stimulus patterns.
