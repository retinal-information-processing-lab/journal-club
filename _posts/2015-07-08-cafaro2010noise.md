> Computation in the nervous system often relies on the integration of signals
> from parallel circuits with different functional properties. Correlated noise
> in these inputs can, in principle, have diverse and dramatic effects on the
> reliability of the resulting computations [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Such theoretical
> predictions have rarely been tested experimentally because of a scarcity of
> preparations that permit measurement of both the covariation of a neuron’s
> input signals and the effect on a cell’s output of manipulating such
> covariation. Here we introduce a method to measure covariation of the
> excitatory and inhibitory inputs a cell receives. This method revealed strong
> correlated noise in the inputs to two types of retinal ganglion cell.
> Eliminating correlated noise without changing other input properties
> substantially decreased the accuracy with which a cell’s spike outputs encoded
> light inputs. Thus, covariation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be a
> critical determinant of the reliability of neural coding and computation.
