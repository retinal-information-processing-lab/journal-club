> Neurons and networks in the cerebral cortex must operate reliably despite
> multiple sources of noise. To evaluate the impact of both input and output
> noise, we determine the robustness of single-neuron stimulus selective
> responses, as well as the robustness of attractor states of networks of
> neurons performing memory tasks. We find that robustness to output noise
> requires synaptic connections to be in a balanced regime in which excitation
> and inhibition are strong and largely cancel each other. We evaluate the
> conditions required for this regime to exist and determine the properties of
> networks operating within it. A plausible synaptic plasticity rule for
> learning that balances weight configurations is presented. Our theory predicts
> an optimal ratio of the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses for
> maximizing the encoding capacity of balanced networks for given statistics of
> afferent activations. Previous work has shown that balanced networks amplify
> spatiotemporal variability and account for observed asynchronous irregular
> states. Here we present a distinct type of balanced network that amplifies
> small changes in the impinging signals and emerges automatically from learning
> to perform neuronal and network functions robustly.
