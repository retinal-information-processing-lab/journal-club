> Vertebrate vision relies on two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which
> signal increments in light intensity with graded hyperpolarizations. Rods
> operate in the lower range of light intensities while cones operate at
> brighter intensities. The receptive fields of both photoreceptors exhibit
> antagonistic center-surround organization. Here we show that at bright light
> levels, mouse rods act as relay cells for cone-driven horizontal cell–mediated
> surround inhibition. In response to large, bright stimuli that activate their
> surrounds, rods depolarize. Rod depolarization increases with stimulus size,
> and its action spectrum matches that of cones. Rod responses at high light
> levels are abolished in mice with nonfunctional cones and when horizontal
> cells are reversibly inactivated. Rod depolarization is conveyed to the inner
> retina via postsynaptic circuit elements, namely the rod bipolar cells. Our
> results show that the retinal circuitry repurposes rods, when they are not
> directly sensing light, to relay cone-driven surround inhibition.
