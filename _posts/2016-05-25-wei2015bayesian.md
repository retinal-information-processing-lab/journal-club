> Bayesian observer models provide a principled account of the fact that our
> perception of the world rarely matches physical reality. The standard
> explanation is that our percepts are biased toward our prior beliefs. However,
> reported psychophysical data suggest that this view may be simplistic. We
> propose a new model formulation based on efficient coding that is fully
> specified for any given natural stimulus distribution. The model makes two new
> and seemingly anti-Bayesian predictions. First, it predicts that perception is
> often biased away from an observer's prior beliefs. Second, it predicts that
> stimulus uncertainty differentially affects perceptual bias depending on
> whether the uncertainty is induced by internal or external noise. We found
> that both model predictions match reported perceptual biases in perceived
> visual orientation and spatial frequency, and were able to explain data that
> have not been explained before. The model is general and should prove
> applicable to other perceptual variables and tasks.
