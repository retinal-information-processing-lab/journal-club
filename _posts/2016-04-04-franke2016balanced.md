> The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different
> types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and
> provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Anatomically,
> mouse bipolar cell types have been described down to the ultrastructural
> level, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is
> lacking. By imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 11,000
> bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we here show that bipolar
> cell functional diversity is generated by the balanced interplay of dendritic
> excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resultant centre and
> surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate
> bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domain. Our findings highlight
> the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse
> excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways
> begins already at the second synapse of the mouse visual system.
