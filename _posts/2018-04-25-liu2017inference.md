> Neurons in sensory systems often pool inputs over arrays of presynaptic cells,
> giving rise to functional subunits inside a neuron’s receptive field. The
> organization of these subunits provides a signature of the neuron’s
> presynaptic functional connectivity and determines how the neuron integrates
> sensory stimuli. Here we introduce the method of spike-triggered non-negative
> matrix factorization for detecting the layout of subunits within a neuron’s
> receptive field. The method only requires the neuron’s spiking responses under
> finely structured sensory stimulation and is therefore applicable to large
> populations of simultaneously recorded neurons. Applied to recordings from
> ganglion cells in the salamander retina, the method retrieves the receptive
> fields of presynaptic bipolar cells, as verified by simultaneous bipolar and
> ganglion cell recordings. The identified subunit layouts allow improved
> predictions of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli and reveal shared
> bipolar cell input into distinct types of ganglion cells.
