In many forms of retinal degeneration,
photoreceptors die but inner retinal circuits remain intact. In the rd1
mouse, an established model for blinding retinal diseases, spontaneous activity in the coupled network of AII amacrine and ON cone
bipolar cells leads to rhythmic bursting of ganglion cells. Since such
activity could impair retinal and/or cortical responses to restored
photoreceptor function, understanding its nature is important for
developing treatments of retinal pathologies. Here we analyzed a
compartmental model of the wild-type mouse AII amacrine cell to
predict that the cellâ€™s intrinsic membrane properties, specifically,
interacting fast Na and slow, M-type K conductances, would allow its
membrane potential to oscillate when light-evoked excitatory synaptic
inputs were withdrawn following photoreceptor degeneration. We
tested and confirmed this hypothesis experimentally by recording
from AIIs in a slice preparation of rd1 retina. Additionally, recordings
from ganglion cells in a whole mount preparation of rd1 retina
demonstrated that activity in AIIs was propagated unchanged to elicit
bursts of action potentials in ganglion cells. We conclude that oscillations are not an emergent property of a degenerated retinal network.
Rather, they arise largely from the intrinsic properties of a single
retinal interneuron, the AII amacrine cell.
