> A critical function of the nervous system is the prediction of future sensory
> input. One such predictive computation is retinal sensitization, a form of
> short-term plasticity seen in multiple species that elevates local sensitivity
> following strong local stimulation. Here we perform a causal circuit analysis
> of retinal sensitization using simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode
> recording in the salamander. We show, using direct current injection into
> inhibitory sustained amacrine cells that a decrease in amacrine transmission
> is necessary, sufficient and occurs at the right time and manner to cause
> sensitization in ganglion cells. Because of neural dynamics and nonlinear
> pathways, a computational model is essential to explain how a change in steady
> inhibitory transmission causes sensitization. Whereas adaptation of excitation
> removes an expected result in order to transmit novelty, adaptation of
> inhibition provides a general mechanism to enhance the sensitivity to the
> sensory feature conveyed by an inhibitory pathway, creating a prediction of
> future input.
