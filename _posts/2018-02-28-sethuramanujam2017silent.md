> Retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) have the remarkable ability
> to encode motion over a wide range of contrasts, relying on well-coordinated
> excitation and inhibition (E/I). E/I is orchestrated by a diverse set of
> glutamatergic bipolar cells that drive DSGCs directly, as well as indirectly
> through feedforward GABAergic/cholinergic signals mediated by starburst
> amacrine cells. Determining how direction-selective responses are generated
> across varied stimulus conditions requires understanding how glutamate,
> acetylcholine, and GABA signals are precisely coordinated. Here, we use a
> combination of paired patch-clamp recordings, serial EM, and large-scale
> multi-electrode array recordings to show that a single high-sensitivity source
> of glutamate is processed differentially by starbursts via AMPA receptors and
> DSGCs via NMDA receptors. We further demonstrate how this novel synaptic
> arrangement enables DSGCs to encode direction robustly near threshold
> contrasts. Together, these results reveal a space-efficient synaptic circuit
> model for direction computations, in which “silent” NMDA receptors play
> critical roles.
