> The retina adjusts its signaling gain over a wide range of light levels. A
> functional result of this is increased visual acuity at brighter luminance
> levels (light adaptation) due to shifts in the excitatory center-inhibitory
> surround receptive field parameters of ganglion cells that increases their
> sensitivity to smaller light stimuli. Recent work supports the idea that
> changes in ganglion cell spatial sensitivity with background luminance are due
> in part to inner retinal mechanisms, possibly including modulation of
> inhibition onto bipolar cells. To determine how the receptive fields of OFF
> cone bipolar cells may contribute to changes in ganglion cell resolution, the
> spatial extent and magnitude of inhibitory and excitatory inputs were measured
> from OFF bipolar cells under dark- and light-adapted conditions. There was no
> change in the OFF bipolar cell excitatory input with light adaptation;
> however, the spatial distributions of inhibitory inputs, including both
> glycinergic and GABAergic sources, became significantly narrower, smaller, and
> more transient. The magnitude and size of the OFF bipolar cell center-surround
> receptive fields as well as light-adapted changes in resting membrane
> potential were incorporated into a spatial model of OFF bipolar cell output to
> the downstream ganglion cells, which predicted an increase in signal output
> strength with light adaptation. We show a prominent role for inner retinal
> spatial signals in modulating the modeled strength of bipolar cell output to
> potentially play a role in ganglion cell visual sensitivity and acuity.
