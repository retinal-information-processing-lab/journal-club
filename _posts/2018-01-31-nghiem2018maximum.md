> Maximum Entropy models can be inferred from large data-sets to uncover how
> local interactions can generate collective dynamics. Here, we employ such
> methods to investigate the characteristics of neurons recorded by
> multielectrode arrays in the cortex of human and monkey throughout states of
> wakefulness and sleep. Taking advantage of the separation of cells into
> excitatory and inhibitory types, we construct a model including this
> biological feature. By comparing the performances of Maximum Entropy models at
> predicting neural activity in wakefulness and deep sleep, we identify the
> dominant interactions between neurons in each brain state. We find that during
> wakefulness, dominant functional interactions are pairwise while during sleep,
> interactions are population-wide. In particular, inhibitory cells are shown to
> be strongly tuned to the inhibitory population. This shows that Maximum
> Entropy models can be useful to analyze data-sets with excitatory and
> inhibitory cells, and can reveal the role of inhibitory cells in organizing
> coherent dynamics in cerebral cortex.
