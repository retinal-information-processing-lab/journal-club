> Adaptation is a hallmark of sensory function. Adapting optimally requires
> matching the dynamics of adaptation to those of changes in the stimulus
> distribution. Here we show that the dynamics of adaptation in the responses of
> mouse retinal ganglion cells depend on stimulus history. We hypothesized that
> the accumulation of evidence for a change in the stimulus distribution
> controls the dynamics of adaptation, and developed a model for adaptation as
> an ongoing inference problem. Guided by predictions of this model, we found
> that the dynamics of adaptation depend on the discriminability of the change
> in stimulus distribution and that the retina exploits information contained in
> properties of the stimulus beyond the mean and variance to adapt more quickly
> when possible.
