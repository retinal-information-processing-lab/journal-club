> Under natural viewing conditions the input to the retina is a complex
> spatiotemporal signal that depends on both the scene and the way the observer
> moves. It is commonly assumed that the retina processes this input signal
> efficiently by taking into account the statistics of the natural world. It has
> recently been argued that incessant microscopic eye movements contribute to
> this process by decorrelating the input to the retina. Here we tested this
> theory by measuring the responses of the salamander retina to stimuli
> replicating the natural input signals experienced by the retina in the
> presence and absence of fixational eye movements. Contrary to the predictions
> of classic theories of efficient encoding that do not take behavior into
> account, we show that the response characteristics of retinal ganglion cells
> are not sufficient in themselves to disrupt the broad correlations of natural
> scenes. Specifically, retinal ganglion cells exhibited strong and extensive
> spatial correlations in the absence of fixational eye movements. However, the
> levels of correlation in the neural responses dropped in the presence of
> fixational eye movements, resulting in effective decorrelation of the channels
> streaming information to the brain. These observations confirm the predictions
> that microscopic eye movements act to reduce correlations in retinal responses
> and contribute to visual information processing.
