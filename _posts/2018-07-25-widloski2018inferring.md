> A goal of systems neuroscience is to discover the circuit mechanisms
> underlying brain function. Despite experimental advances that enable
> circuit-wide neural recording, the problem remains open in part because
> solving the 'inverse problem' of inferring circuity and mechanism by merely
> observing activity is hard. In the grid cell system, we show through modeling
> that a technique based on global circuit perturbation and examination of a
> novel theoretical object called distribution of relative phase shifts (DRPS)
> the could reveal the mechanisms of a cortical circuit at unprecedented detail
> using extremely sparse neural recordings. We establish feasibility, showing
> that the method can discriminate between recurrent versus feedforward
> mechanisms and amongst various recurrent mechanisms using recordings from a
> handful of cells. The proposed strategy demonstrates that sparse recording
> coupled with simple perturbation can reveal more about circuit mechanism than
> can full knowledge of network activity or the synaptic connectivity matrix.
