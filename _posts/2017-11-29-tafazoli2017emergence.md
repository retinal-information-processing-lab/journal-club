> Rodents are emerging as increasingly popular models of visual functions. Yet,
> evidence that rodent visual cortex is capable of advanced visual processing,
> such as object recognition, is limited. Here we investigate how neurons
> located along the progression of extrastriate areas that, in the rat brain,
> run laterally to primary visual cortex, encode object information. We found a
> progressive functional specialization of neural responses along these areas,
> with: (1) a sharp reduction of the amount of low-level, energy-related visual
> information encoded by neuronal firing; and (2) a substantial increase in the
> ability of both single neurons and neuronal populations to support
> discrimination of visual objects under identity-preserving transformations
> (e.g., position and size changes). These findings strongly argue for the
> existence of a rat object-processing pathway, and point to the rodents as
> promising models to dissect the neuronal circuitry underlying
> transformation-tolerant recognition of visual objects.
