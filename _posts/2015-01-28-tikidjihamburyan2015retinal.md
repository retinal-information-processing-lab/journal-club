> The collective activity pattern of retinal ganglion cells, the retinal code,
> underlies higher visual processing. How does the ambient illuminance of the
> visual scene influence this retinal output? We recorded from isolated mouse
> and pig retina and from mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vivo at up
> to seven ambient light levels covering the scotopic to photopic regimes.
> Across each luminance transition, most ganglion cells exhibited qualitative
> response changes, whereas they maintained stable responses within each
> luminance. We commonly observed the appearance and disappearance of ON
> responses in OFF cells and vice versa. Such qualitative response changes
> occurred for a variety of stimuli, including full-field and localized contrast
> steps and naturalistic movies. Our results suggest that the retinal code is
> not fixed but varies with every change of ambient luminance. This finding
> raises questions about signal processing within the retina and has
> implications for visual processing in higher brain areas.
