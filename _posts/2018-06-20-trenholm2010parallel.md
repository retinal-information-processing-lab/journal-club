> In the retina, presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms thatshape directionally
> selective (DS) responses in outputganglion cells are well established.
> However, the nature of inhibition-independent forms of directionalselectivity
> remains poorly defined. Here, we describea genetically specified set of ON-OFF
> DS ganglioncells (DSGCs) that code anterior motion. This entire population of
> DSGCs exhibits asymmetric dendritic arborizations that orientate toward the
> preferred direction. We demonstrate that morphological asymmetries along with
> nonlinear dendritic conductances generate a centrifugal (soma-to-dendrite)
> preferencethat does not critically depend upon, but works inparallel with the
> GABAergic circuitry. We also show that in symmetrical DSGCs, such dendritic DS
> mechanisms are aligned with, or are in opposition to, the inhibitory DS
> circuitry in distinct dendritic subfields where they differentially interact
> to promote or weaken directional preferences. Thus, pre- and post-synaptic DS
> mechanisms interact uniquely in distinct ganglion cell populations, enabling
> efficient DS coding under diverse conditions.
