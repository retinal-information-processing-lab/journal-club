> Much of the information the brain processes and stores is temporal in nature—a spoken
> word or a handwritten signature, for example, is defined by how it unfolds in time.
> However, it remains unclear how neural circuits encode complex time-varying patterns.
> We show that by tuning the weights of a recurrent neural network (RNN), it can recognize
> and then transcribe spoken digits. The model elucidates how neural dynamics in cortical
> networks may resolve three fundamental challenges: first, encode multiple time-varying
> sensory and motor patterns as stable neural trajectories; second, generalize across
> relevant spatial features; third, identify the same stimuli played at different
> speeds—we show that this temporal invariance emerges because the recurrent dynamics
> generate neural trajectories with appropriately modulated angular velocities. Together
> our results generate testable predictions as to how recurrent networks may use different
> mechanisms to generalize across the relevant spatial and temporal features of complex
> time-varying stimuli.
