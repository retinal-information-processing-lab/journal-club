> The brain routinely discovers sensory clues that predict opportunities or
> dangers. However, it is unclear how neural learning processes can bridge the
> typically long delays between sensory clues and behavioral outcomes. Here, I
> introduce a learning concept, aggregate-label learning, that enables
> biologically plausible model neurons to solve this temporal credit assignment
> problem. Aggregate-label learning matches a neuron’s number of output spikes
> to a feedback signal that is proportional to the number of clues but carries
> no information about their timing. Aggregate-label learning outperforms
> stochastic reinforcement learning at identifying predictive clues and is able
> to solve unsegmented speech-recognition tasks. Furthermore, it allows
> unsupervised neural networks to discover reoccurring constellations of sensory
> features even when they are widely dispersed across space and time.
