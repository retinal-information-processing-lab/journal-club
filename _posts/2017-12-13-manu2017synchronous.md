> Visual information is conveyed from the retina to the brain by a diverse set
> of retinal ganglion cells. Although they have differing nonlinear properties,
> nearly all ganglion cell receptive fields on average compute a difference in
> intensity across space and time using a region known as the classical or
> linear surround a property that improves information transmission about
> natural visual scenes. The spatiotemporal visual features that create this
> fundamental property have not been quantitatively assigned to specific
> interneurons. Here we describe a generalizable causal approach using
> simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording to directly measure
> and manipulate the sensory feature conveyed by a neural pathway to a
> downstream neuron. Analyzing two inhibitory cell classes, horizontal cells and
> linear amacrine cells, we find that rather than transmitting different
> temporal features, the two inhibitory pathways act synchronously to create the
> salamander ganglion cell surround at different spatial scales. Using these
> measured visual features and theories of efficient coding, we computed a
> fitness landscape representing the information transmitted using different
> weightings of the two inhibitory pathways. This theoretical landscape revealed
> a ridge that maintains near-optimal information transmission while allowing
> for receptive field diversity. The ganglion cell population showed a striking
> match to this prediction, concentrating along this ridge across a wide range
> of positions using different weightings of amacrine or horizontal cell visual
> features. These results show how parallel neural pathways synthesize a sensory
> computation, and why this architecture achieves the potentially competing
> objectives of high information transmission of individual ganglion cells, and
> diversity among receptive fields.
