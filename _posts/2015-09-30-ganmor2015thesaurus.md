> Information is carried in the brain by the joint spiking patterns of large
> groups of noisy, unreliable neurons. This noise limits the capacity of the
> neural code and determines how information can be transmitted and read-out. To
> accurately decode, the brain must overcome this noise and identify which
> patterns are semantically similar. We use models of network encoding noise to
> learn a thesaurus for populations of neurons in the vertebrate retina
> responding to artificial and natural videos, measuring the similarity between
> population responses to visual stimuli based on the information they carry.
> This thesaurus reveals that the code is organized in clusters of synonymous
> activity patterns that are similar in meaning but may differ considerably in
> their structure. This organization is highly reminiscent of the design of
> engineered codes. We suggest that the brain may use this structure and show
> how it allows accurate decoding of novel stimuli from novel spiking patterns.
