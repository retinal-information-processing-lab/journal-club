> How to discriminate visual stimuli based on the activity they evoke in sensory
> neurons is still an open challenge. To measure discriminability power, we
> search for a neural metric that preserves distances in stimulus space, so that
> responses to different stimuli are far apart and responses to the same
> stimulus are close. Here, we show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
> provide such a distance-preserving neural metric. Even when learned in a
> unsupervised way, RBM-based metric can discriminate stimuli with higher
> resolution than classical metrics.
