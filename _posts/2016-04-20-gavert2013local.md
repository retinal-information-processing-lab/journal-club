> Retinal ganglion cells react to changes in visual contrast by adjusting their
> sensitivity and temporal filtering characteristics. This contrast adaptation
> has primarily been studied under spatially homogeneous stimulation. Yet,
> ganglion cell receptive fields are often characterized by spatial subfields,
> providing a substrate for nonlinear spatial processing. This raises the
> question whether contrast adaptation follows a similar subfield structure or
> whether it occurs globally over the receptive field even for local
> stimulation. We therefore recorded ganglion cell activity in isolated
> salamander retinas while locally changing visual contrast. Ganglion cells
> showed primarily global adaptation characteristics, with notable exceptions
> in certain aspects of temporal filtering. Surprisingly, some changes in
> filtering were most pronounced for locations where contrast did not change.
> This seemingly paradoxical effect can be explained by a simple computational
> model, which emphasizes the importance of local nonlinearities in the retina
> and suggests a reevaluation of previously reported local contrast adaptation.
