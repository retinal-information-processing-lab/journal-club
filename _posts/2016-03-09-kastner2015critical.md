> Computation in the brain involves multiple types of neurons, yet the
> organizing principles for how these neurons work together remain unclear.
> Information theory has offered explanations for how different types of neurons
> can maximize the transmitted information by encoding different stimulus
> features. However, recent experiments indicate that separate neuronal types
> exist that encode the same filtered version of the stimulus, but then the
> different cell types signal the presence of that stimulus feature with
> different thresholds. Here we show that the emergence of these neuronal types
> can be quantitatively described by the theory of transitions between different
> phases of matter. The two key parameters that control the separation of
> neurons into subclasses are the mean and standard deviation (SD) of noise
> affecting neural responses. The average noise across the neural population
> plays the role of temperature in the classic theory of phase transitions,
> whereas the SD is equivalent to pressure or magnetic field, in the case of
> liquid–gas and magnetic transitions, respectively. Our results account for
> properties of two recently discovered types of salamander Off retinal ganglion
> cells, as well as the absence of multiple types of On cells. We further show
> that, across visual stimulus contrasts, retinal circuits continued to operate
> near the critical point whose quantitative characteristics matched those
> expected near a liquid–gas critical point and described by the
> nearest-neighbor Ising model in three dimensions. By operating near a critical
> point, neural circuits can maximize information transmission in a given
> environment while retaining the ability to quickly adapt to a new environment.
