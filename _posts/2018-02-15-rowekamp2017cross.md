> Object recognition relies on a series of transformations among which only the
> first cortical stage is relatively well understood. Already at the second
> stage, the visual area V2, the complexity of the transformation precludes a
> clear understanding of what specifically this area computes. Previous work has
> found multiple types of V2 neurons, with neurons of each type selective for
> multi-edge features. Here we analyse responses of V2 neurons to natural
> stimuli and find three organizing principles. First, the relevant edges for V2
> neurons can be grouped into quadrature pairs, indicating invariance to local
> translation. Second, the excitatory edges have nearby suppressive edges with
> orthogonal orientations. Third, the resulting multi-edge patterns are repeated
> in space to form textures or texture boundaries. The cross-orientation
> suppression increases the sparseness of responses to natural images based on
> these complex forms of feature selectivity while allowing for multiple scales
> of position invariance.
